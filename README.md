# Medical-Domain-Adaptation-with-Transformer

This repository contains implementaion of Transformer for ASR error correction and domain adaptation. Generally speaking, the deterioration in ASR performance can be caused by a domain mismatch between training and test data. Data domain is a specific topic characterizing the nature of the data, such as programming, finance, medicine, etc. This repository demonstrates how to fix domain mismatch errors using machine translation without making changes to the existing trained ASR model.
